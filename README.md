Academic prototype project I created to get my career's title.

As I had already stated in my degree project document:

"The implementation of this project will have a significant academic contribution as the same source code will be placed at the disposal of the community of free software so that it is evaluated and optimized for the benefit of the community. The value of the contribution is increased because modern technologies will be used such as smartphones and HTML 5"

I know I should have done this a long time ago, but anyways. it's finally done.

Since the project is just a prototype, much of the code can be improved in many ways. I must recognize that with the years of experience at my job I have improved the way I code a lot, so looking at this project's code isn't exactly flattering.

The project includes several tools and libraries that were available at the time it was developed, being Jquery and some jquery plugins the most relevant.
